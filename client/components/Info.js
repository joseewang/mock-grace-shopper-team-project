      <h3>Insects have been called the food of the future</h3>
      <p>
        But they’re also the food of the past, with many cultures already
        considering them a delicacy, or at least a good snack
      </p>

    <div>
      <h3>But why insects?</h3>
      <p>
        Estimates vary for just how much food production will need to increase
        to feed our growing global population, but we all know something needs
        to change. Some experts have even argued that raising insects for food
        will become a necessity in the coming century. Rather than seeing
        insects as a food of desperation, however, we see them as an
        opportuity to expand our minds and our palates.

      <h4>
        Bugs offer more than meets the eye: higher nutrient content than
        nearly any populat protein on the market today, coupled with more
        sustainable, humane, and efficient farming methods, minimal
        processing, and minimal - if any - environmental impacts.

      <h3>But why Grace Hoppers?</h3>
      <p>
        Let’s start with a very popular American protein choice: The
        hamburger. With about 20g of protein per 100g of meat, beef also
        contains certain negative nutritional compounds like saturated fats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crickets are often the first-in-line insect alternative to beef - and
        with an average of 60g of protein per 100g of meat, it’s easy to see
        why.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>However, Consider the Grasshopper:</h3>
      <p>
        Grasshoppers contain 20% more protein than crickets - around 72% in
        weight - and contain none of the saturated fat or cholesterol of
        crickets or mealworms, another popular alternative protein.
        Grasshoppers also contain all essential amino acids, as well as
        omega-3, iron, zinc, folic acid, and B12, and have no antibiotics or
        hormones. And, importantly, they have a neutral taste, making them an
        ideal base for our delicious bars, powders, and flours.
