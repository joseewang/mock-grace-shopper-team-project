        <h3>Insects have been called the food of the future</h3>
        <p>
          But they’re also the food of the past, with many cultures already
          considering them a delicacy, or at least a good snack
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>But why insects?</h3>
        <p>
          Estimates vary for just how much food production will need to increase
          to feed our growing global population, but we all know something needs
          to change. Some experts have even argued that raising insects for food
          will become a necessity in the coming century. Rather than seeing
          insects as a food of desperation, however, we see them as an
          opportuity to expand our minds and our palates.

          Bugs offer more than meets the eye: higher nutrient content than
          nearly any populat protein on the market today, coupled with more
          sustainable, humane, and efficient farming methods, minimal
          processing, and minimal - if any - environmental impacts.

        <h3>But why Grace Hoppers?</h3>
        <p>
          Let’s start with a very popular American protein choice: The
          hamburger. With about 20g of protein per 100g of meat, beef also
          contains certain negative nutritional compounds like saturated fats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crickets are often the first-in-line insect alternative to beef - and
          with an average of 60g of protein per 100g of meat, it’s easy to see
          why.
        </p>

        <h3>However, Consider the Grasshopper:</h3>
        <p>
          Grasshoppers contain 20% more protein than crickets - around 72% in
          weight - and contain none of the saturated fat or cholesterol of
          crickets or mealworms, another popular alternative protein.
          Grasshoppers also contain all essential amino acids, as well as
          omega-3, iron, zinc, folic acid, and B12, and have no antibiotics or
          hormones. And, importantly, they have a neutral taste, making them an
          ideal base for our delicious bars, powders, and flours.
